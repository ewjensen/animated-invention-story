It was dark and stormy night in Madison.
The winds were howling and the frats were partying.
There was a wizard weilding a long staff of empty White Claw cans all ducktaped together.
He approached me, and whispered "No laws when you're drinking Claws."
I left there a change man and nothing was the same. 
We all lived happily ever after. 
The End!
